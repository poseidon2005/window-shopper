iOS 11: From Beginner to Paid Professional. Lesson 49 Window shopper: Project creation & custom text fields

## Getting Started

Lesson-01 branch, I've run git init on the folder, prewatched the initial couple minutes of video and downloaded the assets for the project. I have done this readme file and will do initial github push and start the project. I am at the point I will try and do the first layout sections without follow along and see if I can get it correct. I think Mark's style has gotten me to the point I know how to do the setup on my own. Cheers!

Great lesson, 
learned the rounded edge in this lesson and color literial in code with the 25% opacity of the text field that looks cool. Commiting and moving on to branch lesson-02 cheers...

### Prerequisites

window shopper assets are in my github Reference Downloads folder. will do another push to ensure file structure integrity after this lesson.
