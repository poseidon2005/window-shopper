iOS 11: From Beginner to Paid Professional. Lesson 49 Window shopper: Project creation & custom text fields

## Getting Started

Lesson-01 branch, I've run git init on the folder, prewatched the initial couple minutes of video and downloaded the assets for the project. I have done this readme file and will do initial github push and start the project. I am at the point I will try and do the first layout sections without follow along and see if I can get it correct. I think Mark's style has gotten me to the point I know how to do the setup on my own. Cheers!

Great lesson, 
learned the rounded edge in this lesson and color literial in code with the 25% opacity of the text field that looks cool. Commiting and moving on to branch lesson-02 cheers...

Lesson 51 branch lesson-02 testing.... wow very cool to be able to test coding logic. I however was not able as of yet to get the keypad(decimal) to pop up when I either clicked on the text field or clicked the calculate button. Hopefully something that workds itself out when I finish the next couple lessons. The testing did succeed so hurray for me. Feeling more confident each lesson....

Lesson 52 branch lesson-03
App complete! Unit testing and debugging completed. Calculation logic and buttons fully functional. implemented drawrect function to place currency lable inside the text field. Lots learned, ready to move on and forward.
